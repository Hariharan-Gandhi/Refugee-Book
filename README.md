# Refugee-Book
"RefugeeBook" helps refugees to overcome the initial barriers that prevents access from education/online universities and ultimately job opportunities to restart their lives 

The application "RefugeeBook" helps refugees to get in connect with companies. It uses data (user profiles, company profiles, job profiles, course profiles) stored in SAP HANA and matches these data in order to make smart recommendations. This is done by using text mining and machine learning. Additionally, it offers a meta-search to search for online courses on different learning platforms ("google for online courses"). Which helps the refugee to get certificates and gather new knowledge easily. This allows him to verify his knowledge to his potential employer.
