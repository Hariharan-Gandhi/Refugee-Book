			"CourseTitle": "Thermo Dynamics",
			"Description": "In this course, you will learn how to characterize the energy state of a system and the mechanisms for transferring energy from one system to another. These are the tools necessary to understand stationary and transportation power systems from small scale, like batteries, to large scale, like nuclear power plants."

			"CourseTitle": "Thermo Dynamics",
			"Description": "ME209.1x is a basic course in thermodynamics, designed for students of mechanical engineering. We will study the terms and concepts used in thermodynamics, with precise definitions. The three laws of thermodynamics (zeroth, first, and second) will be explored in detail, and the properties of materials will be studied. Many useful relations will be derived.  The topics include: basic concepts and definitions the work interaction the first law, energy, and the heat interaction the zeroth law, temperature, and scales of temperature properties of gases and liquids, equations of state the second law, thermodynamic temperature scales, and entropy relations between properties open thermodynamic systems There will be emphasis on problem-solving. Students will need to spend significant effort on solving exercises. The course is designed for students in mechanical engineering. However, others (both engineers and scientists) are likely to find it useful. The course has also been found to be useful to teachers of thermodynamics. Please note that this course is self-paced and you can enroll at any time.  At normal pace, this course requires 12 weeks of study, about 10 hours a week."
